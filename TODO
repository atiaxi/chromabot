* Pick up / drop off loyalists
* Ability to reply to the bot:
  * to support/oppose bot's parent
* Make sure that commands buried under 'more comments' are actually getting 
  processed (they appear to be now, but make sure) 
* Make us able to move multiple territories at once, but make the time
  equivilant to the number of moves
* Add an auto assign flair system to reduce confusion (/u/chromabot mods all

* pm telling you your army has arrived
* Default rank shouldn't be general
