* Pick up / drop off loyalists
* Figure out some way so that HQ checks aren't hitting about/.json all the
  damn time.  Either less frequent HQ checks or making PRAW work right or
  caching on my end.
* Can we have the bot list multiple time zones in its declaration? 
* Ability to reply to the bot:
  * to support/oppose bot's parent
* "your armies are currently in..." message should mention if armies en route
* Make sure that commands buried under 'more comments' are actually getting 
  processed (they do not appear to be)

* Implement 'defect' command so that people who are mistakenly sorted into
  the wrong team can fix that
* Add committed forces to status
* You might want to add "range" as well as the common misspelling of
  "calvary" to the types it recognizes.
* Make bot post fewer threads - have it turn initial [Invasion] thread into
  a battle thread.
* Make us able to move multiple territories at once, but make the time
  equivilant to the number of moves
* Add an auto assign flair system to reduce confusion (/u/chromabot mods all
  terrotories and assings flairs when someone signs up on the recruitment
  thread)
* pm telling you your army has arrived
